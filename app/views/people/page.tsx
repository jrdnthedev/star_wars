          "Luke Skywalker was a Tatooine farmboy who rose from humble beginnings to become one of the greatest Jedi the galaxy has ever known. Along with his friends Princess Leia and Han Solo, Luke battled the evil Empire, discovered the truth of his parentage, and ended the tyranny of the Sith. A generation later, the location of the famed Jedi master was one of the galaxy’s greatest mysteries. Haunted by Ben Solo’s fall to evil and convinced the Jedi had to end, Luke sought exile on a distant world, ignoring the galaxy’s pleas for help. But his solitude would be interrupted – and Luke Skywalker had one final, momentous role to play in the struggle between good and evil.",
        history:
          "Raised by his aunt and uncle on a Tatooine moisture farm, Luke Skywalker never knew his mother or father. He knew nothing of the Force or Jedi, but longed for a more exciting life. Soon he would have it. With his Uncle Owen’s purchase of new droids R2-D2 and C-3PO, a chain of events was put in place that would change Luke -- and the galaxy -- forever. Artoo, a plucky astromech droid, wandered off in his first night on the farm, telling C-3PO he had to deliver a message to someone named Obi-Wan Kenobi. When Luke went looking for the lost droid, he was attacked by Tusken Raiders and knocked unconscious. Before he could be taken captive, friendly hermit Ben Kenobi appeared and frightened off the Sand People. Ben revealed that he was indeed Obi-Wan Kenobi, and had something that belonged to Luke’s father: a lightsaber, the weapon of a Jedi. Obi-Wan said that he and Luke’s father were both Jedi Knights, strong with the Force, and good friends. Luke knew none of this, and asked how his father died. The old Jedi said that his former student, Darth Vader, turned to the dark side and killed him. Obi-Wan and Luke soon discovered that Artoo was indeed carrying a message after all. It was a holorecording of Princess Leia, stating that she had hidden stolen plans for the Empire’s ultimate weapon, the Death Star, in the memory banks of Artoo; she asked that Kenobi deliver the plans to her father on Alderaan. Obi-Wan implored Luke to come with him, but the farmboy refused. However, he and Obi-Wan found that the Jawas who sold his uncle Artoo and Threepio had been slaughtered by stormtroopers -- and they may have traced them back home. Luke raced to the moisture farm, only to find the charred remains of his guardians. Stoic, he decided to leave Tatooine, vowing to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like his father. Along with hired pilot Han Solo and his co-pilot and friend Chewbacca, Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids headed for Alderaan aboard the Millennium Falcon. But when they arrived, the planet wasn’t there -- only rubble, as it had been destroyed by the Empire’s Death Star. The Falcon was soon caught in the tractor beam of the giant space station, but it proved fortuitous; Princess Leia was being held there. Luke and Han, in stormtrooper disguises, staged a rescue while Obi-Wan disengaged the tractor beam. The Jedi Master, however, encountered his old student, Darth Vader, and was killed in battle. Luke saw it happen shortly before escaping in the Falcon, and was deeply affected by the loss of his mentor. The small band of heroes regrouped with the Rebel Alliance on Yavin 4. With the Death Star plans successfully delivered, Luke joined the mission to destroy the battle station, piloting an X-wing under the call sign Red Five. In the ensuing battle, the Rebels suffered heavy losses, and Darth Vader entered the fray in his TIE Advanced. One of the last remaining pilots, Luke flew through the Death Star trench at blinding speed with the goal of shooting a volley of proton torpedoes into a small exhaust port. Vader closed in, ready to destroy Luke's starship -- noting that “the Force is strong with this one” -- but a surprise blast from Han and the Millennium Falcon sent Vader's fighter tumbling into space, clearing Luke for the shot. Calling on the Force with guidance from Obi-Wan’s disembodied voice, the Jedi-to-be delivered a precise shot, and the Death Star was destroyed. Though the Rebel Alliance had struck a major blow against the Empire with the destruction of the Death Star, the war was far from over. The Alliance built a new secret base on the ice planet Hoth, with Luke now a commander. While out on patrol, Luke spotted what he thought was a meteor impact on the surface -- in reality, it was an Imperial probe droid. Before he could inspect it, however, Luke was viciously attacked by a towering wampa. Though Luke escaped the ice creature’s cave, severing the monster’s arm with his lightsaber, the young Jedi nearly died from the frigid surface temperatures. It was also at this time that he was visited by the spectre of Obi-Wan Kenobi, who instructed him to go to the Dagobah system. There, he would learn the ways of the Force from Yoda, a Jedi Master. Han eventually found Luke, keeping him warm inside a tauntaun’s belly until help could arrive. Luke recovered from his injuries and lead the Rebel defense against the Empire’s ground forces, including massive AT-AT walkers, giving the Alliance time to evacuate the planet. Luke headed to Dagobah as instructed and found Yoda. He was not what Luke expected -- small, alien, and green, with a unique backwards way of speaking. Luke trained hard, failing often but learning much from his wise Master. During an exercise, the young Jedi saw a vision of his friends in pain; Luke cut his training short -- against Yoda's wishes -- to help them. He left for Cloud City where Darth Vader awaited, hoping to capture Luke and bring him to the Emperor. They dueled, but Luke was outmatched and overpowered. Luke was battered and bloodied in the fight, losing a hand, and the Sith Lord revealed a frightening truth: that he was in fact Luke’s father. Vader wanted his son to join him on the dark side, and together they could overthrow the Emperor and rule the galaxy. Luke was shattered and in disbelief. He refused to turn, managing to escape with his life. With Han frozen in carbonite and held in Jabba the Hutt’s palace on Tatooine, Luke led a mission to rescue his old friend. Now a powerful Jedi Knight, Luke tried to bargain for Han’s life but the crime lord refused. Through a trap door, he dispatched the Jedi into an underground dungeon and unleashed his massive rancor creature. But to the shock of Jabba and his henchmen, Luke was able to destroy the beast. Incensed, the gangster sentenced Luke and his friends to die in the Sarlacc, but again, the Jedi was underestimated. Luke decimated Jabba’s men, and the group of heroes completed their rescue. With Han safe, Luke returned to Dagobah to complete his training. Yoda, however, was dying. In his final moments, the old Master told Luke that he required no more lessons, but he had to confront Darth Vader -- who was his true father -- once more. Yoda also told him of another Skywalker, who Obi-Wan would confirm was Leia, his twin sister. Meanwhile, the Empire was constructing a new Death Star -- with the Emperor personally overseeing its completion. Utilizing stolen schematics, the Rebel Alliance formulated a plan to destroy this new superweapon. Luke joined his friends for the mission on Endor, but departed when he sensed Vader’s presence. Luke believed there was still good in his father, that the Emperor had not driven it from him fully. He tried to convert Vader to the light side, but the Dark Lord claimed it was too late. Instead, he brought Luke before the Emperor on the Death Star. The evil Sith Master looked to turn Luke to the dark side, and goaded him into a duel with his father. When Vader suggested that Leia could be turned to evil, Luke embraced his rage and pummeled his father relentlessly -- giving the Emperor exactly what he wanted. But before he delivered the killing blow, Luke paused, remembering his teachings. Calming himself, Luke threw away his weapon. “I am a Jedi, like my father before me,” he said. The Emperor, confounded by Luke’s actions, unleashed Force lightning upon the young Jedi. Vader rose and threw the Emperor down a deep shaft, his true self reawakened by his son’s love. Luke had one final moment with his father, and escaped the space station before it was destroyed. The once reckless farmboy’s journey was complete: he was a mature Jedi, freedom was restored to the galaxy, and his compassion had saved his father. After the Battle of Endor, Luke traveled the galaxy with R2-D2, seeking long-forgotten Jedi lore as he pondered how to resurrect the Jedi order. But his efforts ended with one of his apprentices leaving his plans in ruin. After this tragedy Luke vanished, and no one knew where he had chosen to spend his self-imposed exile. The scavenger Rey tracked Luke down on Ahch-To, and pleaded with him to return and help the Resistance. Rey also needed his help to understand her burgeoning Force powers. Luke refused, telling her it was time for the Jedi to end. When Rey resisted refused to leave, Luke reluctantly agreed to teach her enough that she would understand why he had made his decision. Rey insisted that the galaxy needed the legend of Luke Skywalker, a plea that seemed to fall on deaf ears. She left Ahch-To, but Luke had opened himself to the Force – and a last lesson from his old master, Yoda. Luke projected himself through the Force to confront Kylo Ren on Crait, giving the Resistance a chance to escape the First Order. He passed into the Force, but his legend would continue to inspire the galaxy.",

          "C-3PO longs for more peaceful times, but his continued service to the Resistance — and his knowledge of more than seven million forms of communication — keeps the worry-prone droid in the frontlines of galactic conflict. Programmed for etiquette and protocol, Threepio was built by a young Anakin Skywalker, and has been a constant companion to astromech R2-D2. Over the years, he was involved in some of the galaxy’s most defining moments and thrilling battles. Since the Empire’s defeat, C-3PO has served Leia Organa, head of a Resistance spy ring aimed at undermining the First Order.",
        history:
          "Anakin Skywalker, a Tatooine slave boy, was gifted in engineering -- and was strong with the Force. To help his mother, Shmi, he secretly built a droid: C-3PO. In his earliest form, Threepio had no outside covering, and so appeared “naked,” with his internal parts and motors showing. When Anakin befriended a group of stranded travelers, C-3PO was introduced to R2-D2, their heroic astromech. The two quickly became a duo, though when Anakin departed Tatooine to become a Jedi, he left his droid behind. C-3PO continued to serve Shmi, as well as her new husband, Cliegg Lars, and their son Owen. Ten years after Anakin had left Tatooine to become a Jedi, he returned home due to visions that his mother was in distress. C-3PO met Anakin outside the Lars homestead; though they both had changed -- Threepio now had a gray outer casing, and Anakin had grown up -- they recognized each other. “The Maker!” Threepio exclaimed. But this was not a happy reunion, as Shmi had been kidnapped by Sand People and would later die from wounds suffered at the hands of the Tuskens. C-3PO left with Anakin (and his old friend R2-D2) for Geonosis, where Obi-Wan Kenobi was held as prisoner. Geonosis was home to a massive droid factory, and inside it, Threepio had a bit of a misadventure -- accidentally swapping heads with a battle droid. Both his body and his head found themselves on the wrong side of the first battle of the Clone Wars, though R2-D2 finally made things right. After the Battle of Geonosis, C-3PO assisted his friends and the clone army on certain missions. In one adventure on Aleen, the droid and his counterpart, R2-D2, found themselves lost beneath the planet’s surface in a subterranean world. They encountered the Kindalo, strange creatures resembling trees come to life, who were angry with Aleen’s surface dwellers. This led C-3PO and Artoo to Orphne, a beautiful reptilian nymph; she informed the duo that a divide between the surface and underground had been breached, poisoning the subsurface. Threepio and Artoo offered to seal the breach, moving a heavy door back into place that restored the planetary balance. C-3PO served Senator Padmé Amidala, Anakin Skywalker's secret wife, on Coruscant throughout the Clone Wars. As the calamitous events of Order 66 erupted around them, Threepio felt helpless. He bore witness to everything: the decimation of the Jedi, the fall of Anakin, and the birth of the Skywalker twins. When the dust settled, he and R2-D2 were assigned to Captain Antilles aboard the Tantive IV -- but Threepio had seen too much. Senator Bail Organa ordered that C-3PO’s mind be wiped, a development which R2-D2 found just a little humorous. In the intervening 19 years after the rise of the Empire, C-3PO and R2-D2 stayed in the service of their master, Captain Antilles. Antilles was a Rebel, however, and his ship was boarded by Imperials upon the theft of Death Star plans. C-3PO and R2-D2 made a daring escape in a life pod, landing on the desert world Tatooine. The two droids bickered -- Artoo called Threepio a “mindless philosopher” -- and separated, but both were eventually recovered by Jawas. The scavengers sold the droids to Owen Lars, a moisture farmer, who charged his nephew Luke Skywalker with care of the droids. Then, an adventure unfolded: R2-D2 was actually the custodian of the stolen Death Star plans, and Luke, along with new companions Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the droids left to bring them to Princess Leia on Alderaan. By the time this new group had arrived at Alderaan, however, it was too late. The planet was gone, destroyed by the Death Star -- which now held Leia captive. Instead, the small band’s ship, the Millennium Falcon, had been caught in the space station’s tractor beam. Through some smart trickery, they evaded capture and rescued Leia; and during the heroes’ escape, C-3PO and R2-D2 saved their friends from being crushed in a trash compactor. Back on the Falcon, they fled to the Rebel base on Yavin 4. The plans were delivered and the Rebels launched on attack on the Death Star, with Luke taking R2-D2 in his X-wing. While the massive weapon was destroyed, Artoo suffered devastating injuries; C-3PO volunteered to donate parts for his friend’s restoration, but he needn’t have worried -- the astromech was fully repaired, and both were included in the Alliance’s medal ceremony that celebrated this important victory over the Empire. In the wake of the Battle of Yavin, the Rebel Alliance relocated to the ice planet Hoth. C-3PO remained with his masters and friend R2-D2, serving as an interpreter and performing various other functions. When the Empire dispatched a probe droid to the world’s surface, it was Threepio who identified the signal as foreign and possibly an Imperial code. In the resulting evacuation, he left with Han, Leia, and Chewbacca aboard the Millennium Falcon. The droid often found himself at odds with and perplexed by Han, who had no patience for C-3PO’s statistics, odds-quoting, and worrying. When the group later landed on Cloud City, believing they’d found safe haven, Threepio was the first to discover the truth. Encountering a stormtrooper, he was blasted at point blank range and his limbs were scattered; when partially reassembled by Chewbacca, his internal memory banks revealed that just before he was shot, C-3PO had planned to warn his friends. While Han was ultimately frozen in carbonite and turned over to bounty hunter Boba Fett, C-3PO and his friends managed to escape. He was reassembled, and a plan was put in place to rescue Han. With Han frozen in carbonite and held in Jabba the Hutt’s palace, C-3PO and R2-D2 were dispatched by Luke to deliver a message to the crime lord. They walked together, once again, through the Tatooine desert before arriving at a massive gated entrance. C-3PO was visibly nervous. He wanted to leave -- but the door was answered, and the droids entered the lair. Standing before the mighty Jabba, R2-D2 played a holographic projection of Luke, now a Jedi Knight, asking to bargain for Han’s life and offering the droids as token of goodwill. C-3PO was shocked at this turn of events. Indeed, Jabba turned down the offer but accepted the protocol droid and astromech, and quickly put C-3PO to work as an interpreter. It was trying for Threepio, but in time, the truth behind Luke’s plan was revealed: his lightsaber was hidden inside R2-D2, and after his arrival, used it to destroy the gangster’s henchmen. Han was rescued, Leia killed Jabba, and they all left to continue the fight against the Empire. After regrouping with the Rebel Alliance, C-3PO joined Han, Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 on a mission to Endor. The goal: destroy the shield generator protecting Death Star II, the Empire’s new battle station. The group traveled the moon’s forests looking for the bunker, but Chewbacca’s ill-advised curiosity over a dead animal triggered a trap: they were caught in a net, and hoisted high above the ground. As they escaped, short furry creatures surrounded them. Called Ewoks, they appeared somewhat hostile -- until they glimpsed C-3PO. Immediately, they knelt before him and began chanting; the Ewoks believed the gold droid was some sort of god. The primitive creatures took everyone captive except for Threepio, who they carried and worshiped. Back in their village, the Ewoks planned to hold a banquet in C-3PO’s honor. The main course: Han, Luke, and Chewbacca. With some quick thinking, Luke told the droid to inform the creatures that if they did not free his friends, he would become angry and use his magic. C-3PO was confused, but did as told. Reaching out through the Force, Luke levitated Threepio above the villagers, which sent them into a panic. The Ewoks quickly freed the heroes, and once everything calmed down, C-3PO expertly told the Ewoks the story of his friends and the Rebellion. They were officially adopted into the tribe, which proved to be an important alliance; in the attack on the Empire’s shield generator, the Ewoks turned the tide of battle. As a result, the Death Star II was destroyed and the galaxy became free once again. After the Battle of Endor, C-3PO served Leia Organa during the fight to defeat the Empire’s remnants and the uneasy peace that followed. Following the rise of the First Order, C-3PO assisted Leia in her role as founder and leader of the Resistance. The protocol droid’s duties have expanded to include overseeing the movement’s network of spy droids, which operate across the galaxy. On a mission to Pasaana, C-3PO discovered safeguards in his programming made it impossible for him to translate Sith runes that could help the Resistance locate the legendary planet Exegol. With the fate of the galaxy hanging in the balance, C-3PO reluctantly agreed to have his memory erased so the runes could be read. Fortunately, this mechanical amnesia was only temporary, as R2-D2 had backed up his friend’s memories before C-3PO left. The protocol droid’s memories were soon restored, and he celebrated with his friends after they returned from their hard-won victory at Exegol.",

          "A reliable and versatile astromech droid, R2-D2 has served Padmé Amidala, Anakin Skywalker, and Luke Skywalker in turn, showing great bravery in rescuing his masters and their friends from many perils. A skilled starship mechanic and fighter pilot's assistant, he has an unlikely but enduring friendship with the fussy protocol droid C-3PO.",
        history:
          "After the Trade Federation's occupation of her planet, Queen Amidala attempted a daring escape through an orbiting blockade of warships. Her Naboo Royal Starship suffered heavy damage, however, and several astromech droids were dispatched to make emergency repairs. Attached to the ship’s exterior, they were picked off one by one by relentless enemy fire. Yet a certain plucky droid remained: R2-D2, a white and blue model. He successfully restored the ship’s shields, giving it the chance needed to make the jump to hyperspace. R2-D2 was recognized by the Queen for his service, and he would accompany her handmaiden, Padmé, Jar Jar Binks, and Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn when they reached Tatooine. On the desert planet, he was introduced to a still-under-construction protocol droid called C-3PO. They were fast friends, and Artoo immediately chided Threepio for being “naked,” as his parts were showing. Later, R2-D2 would assist nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker in a Naboo N-1 starfighter during the Battle of Naboo. R2-D2 remained in the service of Padmé -- in reality, the former Queen of Naboo -- who was now a Senator. He watched over her after assassination attempts masterminded by Jango Fett, and accompanied her and Anakin on a visit to Naboo. Later, however, the curious astromech found himself reunited with C-3PO on Tatooine. Together, they left with Anakin and Padmé for the Separatist world of Geonosis. R2-D2, his protocol droid friend, and his masters entered the Geonosians’ massive droid factory, which was building an army to strike against the Republic. R2-D2 saved Padmé’s life, jetting to a computer terminal and shutting down the assembly line before the Naboo Senator was bathed in molten metal. After a mishap in the factory, C-3PO temporarily swapped heads with a battle droid; luckily, Artoo was there to help restore his counterpart. During the Clone Wars, R2-D2 was both a pilot’s assistant to Anakin and a secret weapon to the Republic. In one of his many adventures, he joined four other droids in D-Squad: an elite unit tasked with recovering an encryption module from a Separatist ship. But their escapades didn’t end there; the ragtag group, led by Colonel Meebur Gascon, crash landed on the void-world Abafar. They met an amnesiac clone trooper called Gregor, who later recalled his true self and helped the team escape the planet. Finally, when D-Squad found themselves to be the only chance to stop a deadly Separatist plot, R2-D2 made the ultimate sacrifice -- thankfully, Anakin ordered a search for his friend and had the droid restored. Later, R2-D2 assisted Yoda in his journey across the galaxy. He traveled with the Jedi Master to Dagobah, a mysterious Force planet, and Moraband. Throughout the three years of the Clone Wars, R2-D2 was Anakin’s loyal helper and sidekick. In a daring rescue of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, R2-D2 served as his master’s assistant in his Jedi starfighter. The astromech successfully destroyed a buzz droid that was threatening to shut down Anakin’s ship, and later destroyed two super battle droids himself. But with Anakin’s turn to the dark side and the formation of the Empire, the astromech was once again paired with C-3PO and assigned a new master: Captain Antilles. He would remain in Antilles’ service for 19 years until fate would intervene… After years of tyrannical Imperial rule, a fledgling Rebellion won its first real victory against the Empire by stealing plans to its dreaded Death Star. Darth Vader tracked the schematics to the Tantive IV, which he boarded with a squad of stormtroopers. Princess Leia Organa, a secret Rebel leader, hid the data tapes in the memory banks of R2-D2, and the astromech jettisoned the ship with C-3PO. Landing on Tatooine, the droids were captured by Jawas and sold to Owen Lars, a moisture farmer; Lars charged his nephew, Luke Skywalker, with care of the droids -- but Artoo proved difficult to control. He left the homestead on his own, claiming he was on a mission to deliver a message to Obi-Wan Kenobi. It turned out to be true: the Princess had recorded a distress message for Obi-Wan, detailing what to do with the stolen plans kept inside the astromech. Meanwhile, the Empire began a massive hunt for the droids, leading stormtroopers to kill Lars and his wife, Beru. Luke, Obi-Wan, new companions Han Solo and Chewbacca, and Artoo and Threepio left to help the Princess. Later, with Leia rescued and the Death Star’s digital blueprints successfully delivered, the Rebel Alliance launched an attack on the space station. R2-D2, while a little beat-up, was picked by Luke to accompany him in his X-wing. The droid helped his new master with repairs and technical assistance, but took severe damage in the ensuing battle. Still, Luke destroyed the technological terror, and R2-D2 was fully restored and repaired. After an Imperial attack on the Rebel Alliance's Hoth base, Luke and Artoo headed for Dagobah in search of Yoda, a Jedi Master. Upon landing, R2-D2 slipped into a murky swamp and was attacked by a giant serpent-like creature; the plucky droid managed to escape, and kept Luke company until the arrival of a small, quirky green alien. Artoo and the strange visitor had a minor tussle over Luke’s lamp, with the astromech ultimately relinquishing it on Luke’s orders. As it turned out, the odd being was actually Yoda himself, and Luke’s training soon began. Some time later, Luke left for Cloud City to face Darth Vader, R2-D2 in tow. While the droid and his master were cut off from each other, Artoo reconnected with C-3PO and friends, helping them escape from the clutches of the Empire. Han Solo had been frozen in carbonite and delivered to Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine, a heartbreaking turn of events for his friends. They devised a rescue mission, however, with R2-D2 and C-3PO at the center of the plot. The droids infiltrated Jabba’s palace, setting the stage for Leia, Chewbacca, and an unarmed Luke to join them -- and be taken prisoner. Just before Luke was to be pushed into the Sarlacc by one of Jabba’s henchmen, the plan was revealed: R2-D2 had been carrying the Jedi’s lightsaber the entire time, and launched it directly into his waiting hand. Luke led the destruction of the crime lord’s forces and Han’s rescue was complete. Artoo again accompanied Luke to Dagobah, where the Jedi said goodbye to a dying Yoda. They then regrouped with their friends and left for Endor, the forest moon housing the Death Star II’s shield generator. In the ensuing Battle of Endor, R2-D2 stayed close to C-3PO, and made an attempt to open the blast doors of the shield generator’s bunker. Unfortunately for Artoo, the bunker’s security system overloaded the droid’s circuits. He was later repaired, however, and joined his friends and new Ewok companions in a joyous victory celebration. After the Battle of Endor, R2-D2 accompanied Luke on many missions to recover lost Jedi lore and rebuild the Jedi order. Artoo witnessed both triumphs and tragedies, culminating in Luke’s decision to retreat into exile. With his master vanished, R2-D2 sunk into a kind of droid funk, entering a self-imposed low-power mode and ignoring all entreaties to engage with those around him. He became an odd sight at the Resistance base on D’Qar, a reminder of the glory days of the Rebellion who was sometimes visited by a melancholy C-3PO. Happily, the droid revived at a critical moment, helping BB-8 discover the location of Luke’s planet of exile. R2-D2 then joined Rey and Chewbacca on their journey to Ahch-To, where he was reunited with his former master. The plucky astromech continued to assist the Resistance as it rebuilt after the Battle of Crait. R2-D2 was with Leia when she died – as he had witnessed her birth. He was able to restore C-3PO’s memories after his friend returned from Pasaana and Kef Bir. And he flew into battle again, serving as Poe Dameron’s astromech during the raid on Exegol.",

          "Once the heroic Jedi Knight named Anakin Skywalker, Darth Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. Forever scarred by his defeat on Mustafar, Vader was transformed into a cybernetically-enhanced Sith Lord. At the dawn of the Empire, Vader led the Empire’s eradication of the Jedi Order and the search for survivors. He remained in service of the Emperor -- the evil Darth Sidious -- for decades, enforcing his Master’s will and seeking to crush the Rebel Alliance and other detractors. But there was still good in him…",
        history:
          "Before he became a disciple of the dark side, Darth Vader was Anakin Skywalker, a goodhearted Jedi and hero of the Clone Wars. While he was considered one of the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy, Anakin had broken the Order’s code by secretly marrying Senator Padmé Amidala. When he began to suffer visions that Padmé would die in childbirth, Anakin sought a way to prevent this fate. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, a mentor to the young Jedi, claimed that the dark side was a pathway to this ability: he could stop people from dying with Sith power. At the same time, the Chancellor revealed that he himself was a Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, and would train Anakin. Confused and conflicted, Anakin ultimately succumbed to Sidious’ temptations. Rechristened as Darth Vader, he became an agent of evil. Sidious assumed the mantle of Emperor, and Vader helped the Empire destroy the Jedi Order; without mercy, Anakin led a legion of clones into the Jedi Temple, and personally killed both fully trained Jedi and novice younglings alike. On the lava planet Mustafar, where he had been sent to assassinate Separatist leaders, Vader battled his former Master and friend, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin fought with an aggressive ferocity, ignoring Obi-Wan's pleas to come to his senses. Ultimately, the Jedi Master bested the new Sith. Vader was left severely injured and burned on the banks of a lava river, filled with anger and hate. He was found by the Emperor and encased in frightening black armor that kept him alive, and given mechanical lungs that emitted an ominous breathing sound with his every step. Anakin Skywalker was no more. Vader quickly became a symbol of the Empire, serving as Palpatine’s fearsome enforcer. He hunted down fugitive Jedi who had escaped Order 66, backed by the fearsome Inquisitorius. Vader’s sudden arrival within the Imperial hierarchy gave rise to many rumors. Some high-ranking Imperials claimed he was a laboratory creation built to mimic the fallen Separatist warlord General Grievous, while others whispered that he was a technologically augmented warrior schooled in the now-forbidden arts of the Force. Only a few guessed the truth -- that Vader was the reborn Jedi, Anakin Skywalker. Vader's fall to darkness was punctuated by the resurgence of his old master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, about 10 years into the Empire's reign. Forced out of hiding, the former master and his fallen apprentice were reunited on Mapuzo. This time, it was Kenobi who was badly injured in the fight, suffering severe burns after being dragged through a wall of flame. However, Kenobi regained his health and his spiritual strength; when they clashed sabers not long after, Obi-Wan emerged victorious, leaving Vader with a shattered helmet, and stoking his seething hatred. While the Inquisitors hunted other escaped Jedi as well as new Force-sensitive beings that might pose a threat to the Empire, Vader turned his attention to working with the ambitious and ruthless Grand Moff Tarkin to supervise construction of the Death Star and stamp out resistance to Imperial rule. After the Grand Inquisitor's death, Vader became a more active participant in the hunt for the Lothal rebels and their Jedi. He set a trap for the freedom fighters and easily bested Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger in lightsaber combat, though the Jedi survived the encounter. Vader also single-handedly wiped out most of Phoenix Squadron, but it was during this battle that he made a startling discovery: Ahsoka Tano lived. Vader later tracked Tano and the rebels to the Sith Temple on Malachor, and found Bridger there, alone. He quickly defeated the young Padawan, destroying his lightsaber and ready to deliver a killing blow. But he was interrupted by the former pupil of Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano. Vader offered mercy if she would lead him to any survivng Jedi, but Tano refused; in return, the Sith Lord threatened to torture Bridger for the information. Tano now saw that her Master was truly dead, and the two dueled. She held her own and struck Vader in the mask, severing the face plate. Upon seeing her former Master, Ahsoka called him \"Anakin,\" saying she would not leave him. \"Then you will die,\" Vader replied. Tano Force pushed her Jedi friends clear of the Temple, and clashed with Vader once more as the ancient building collapsed around them. Following the duel, Vader limped back to his ship. Surprisingly, Darth Vader constructed his own castle, a testament to his might, at the site of his greatest defeat: the fiery lava-world, Mustafar. The location and design of the castle came as much from the dark side as it did from Vader's personal history, however; the complex sits atop an ancient Sith cave, and the tuning towers serve as a conduit for the dark side of the Force. Vader would rest in his castle, often in solitary meditation or alone in a bacta tank, awaiting orders from his Master. Once the Death Star was complete and tested on Jedha, he summoned Director Orson Krennic, instructing the Imperial that the superweapon was to remain a covert tool of destruction. Only when the time was right would its existence be revealed to the galaxy. When the plans for the Death Star were stolen, Vader would take action to clean up Krennic's mess, personally slaughtering a squad of rebel soldiers and leading the hunt for the data tapes. Nineteen years after his battle with Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader remained the Empire’s tyrannical hand. Upon the Rebel Alliance’s theft of schematics for the Empire’s ultimate weapon, the planet-sized Death Star, Vader led an attack on a suspected Rebel vessel, seeking to recover the stolen plans and find the location of the Rebel base. Meanwhile, Rebel leader Princess Leia hid the data tapes -- and a distress message -- inside the droid R2-D2, sending him to Tatooine in search of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Vader and his stormtroopers killed all aboard with the exception of the Princess, opting to take her to the Death Star for interrogation. Leia proved able to resist a mind probe, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, having received Artoo’s message, soon arrived with the astromech, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and C-3PO. Vader and Obi-Wan clashed one last time, with the Sith Lord striking down his former Master. Luke, Leia, and the heroes were able to escape, but only because the Empire allowed it: Vader had placed a tracking device on their ship, which led the Empire to the Rebel’s secret base. As the Death Star closed in, the Rebels mounted an attack, with Vader himself entering the fray in his TIE Advanced starfighter. Streaming through the Death Star trench and about to finish off the last of the Rebels -- Luke Skywalker in his X-wing -- Vader and his wingmen were attacked from behind by the Millennium Falcon. Ricocheted away from the Death Star and spun out of control, Vader was unable to stop Luke. The space station was destroyed, but Vader survived, and he flew into the far reaches of space. After the destruction of the Death Star, Darth Vader became obsessed with finding Luke Skywalker. He had dispatched probe droids across the galaxy, finally locating the Rebel base on the remote ice planet Hoth. Upon his arrival the Rebels had already escaped, but he pursued Luke’s friends with relentless fervor. With the Empire unable to secure the Millennium Falcon, Vader hired bounty hunters to track down the starship, and the deadly Boba Fett eventually set a trap for the heroes on Cloud City. Believing they had found sanctuary, Han, Leia, and company actually found Vader and the Empire waiting. Vader tortured Han in an effort to lure Luke to Bespin, and later had Solo frozen in carbonite. Finally, Luke, who had cut his Jedi training short to save his friends, arrived and dueled with Vader. The Sith Lord proved too powerful; he brutalized Luke with flying debris, and eventually severed his right hand with his lightsaber. Seeking to bring Luke to the dark side, Vader revealed that he was Luke’s father -- a shock that rattled the young Jedi to the core. Rather than join Vader, Luke chose to fall into a deep abyss, and survived. With the Empire looking to crush the Rebel Alliance once and for all, construction of a second Death Star commenced. Darth Vader and the Emperor were personally overseeing its completion, though Vader’s Master had another plan: to lure Luke Skywalker to the dark side of the Force. Vader and the Emperor waited for Luke to come to them, which he did; the young Jedi believed there was still good in his father, and tried to turn him back to the light side. Vader was conflicted, but still brought Luke before the Dark Lord. The Emperor taunted and tempted Luke, leading to a final duel between Vader and his son. Giving in to his hate, Luke overpowered Vader, cutting off his hand and was poised to deliver the killing blow. The Emperor commanded that Luke finish his father and join the dark side, but the young Jedi refused, opting instead to throw away his lightsaber. Enraged at this denial, the Emperor shot Force lightning into Luke, torturing him. Vader rose, the good in him awakened by his son’s compassion, and destroyed the Emperor. While he had suffered fatal injuries from the Emperor’s lightning, Vader’s redeeming final act restored his consciousness to Anakin Skywalker, and he had one last moment with Luke before peacefully accepting his death.

          "Princess Leia Organa was one of the greatest leaders of the Rebel Alliance, fearless on the battlefield and dedicated to ending the Empire’s tyranny. Daughter of Padmé Amidala and Anakin Skywalker, sister of Luke Skywalker, and with a soft spot for scoundrels, Leia ranked among the galaxy’s great heroes. But life under the New Republic proved difficult for her. Sidelined by a new generation of political leaders, she struck out on her own to oppose the First Order as founder of the Resistance. These setbacks in her political career were accompanied by more personal losses, which she endured with her seemingly inexhaustible will.",
        history:
          "Padmé Amidala, secret wife of Anakin Skywalker, became pregnant with twins toward the end of the Clone Wars. Shortly after Anakin’s turn to the dark side and a violent attack on Padmé, the Naboo Senator went into labor, but something was wrong: according to medical droids, she had lost the will to live. She gave birth to twins -- Luke and Leia -- before dying. Leia was taken in by Senator Bail Organa, a friend of Padmé’s and an ally of the Jedi, and raised as his daughter on Alderaan. At an early age, much was expected of Princess Leia Organa. She’d have much rather escaped into the wooded palace grounds to watch incoming starships than sit through ceremony, however. As a member of the Royal House of Alderaan, she became a fixture at royal receptions until kidnappers absconded with the young girl. Acting on a call for help from her parents, Ben Kenobi rescued Leia, first from the streets of Daiyu, and later from a harrowing torture chamber in the heart of the Fortress Inquisitorius. Although she would long remember their eventful adventure, the future rebel hero carefully guarded knowledge of Kenobi’s location and his very existence until her most desperate hour. In her teens, Leia led a secret mission on behalf of her father: delivering three cruisers to the Phoenix Squadron rebels. She brought the ships to Lothal under the Senate-approved guise of a relief mission for the citizenry, but instead worked with the Ghost crew's Kanan and Ezra to stage a theft of the craft. While there were some hiccups, the Princess showed a strong sense of leadership and fearlessness, and the operation proved a success. Leia continued secretly working to undermine the Empire. When the Rebellion became aware of the Death Star, a small band absconded to Scarif where they daringly stole schematics of the battle station. The data tapes were beamed to a rebel ship and barely passed to the Tantive IV, where Organa received them. When asked what the transmission was, Organa simply replied: \"Hope.\" Aboard her ambassadorial vessel, Tantive IV, Princess Leia Organa was custodian of stolen plans to the Death Star, the Empire’s ultimate weapon. While Leia was a member of the Imperial Senate, she was also one of the Rebel Alliance’s most dedicated leaders. Her ship was boarded by Darth Vader and Imperial forces, but she managed to hide the schematics and a message in the droid R2-D2, who escaped alongside his counterpart C-3PO. Leia, however, was captured by stormtroopers and confronted by Vader, who didn’t believe her claim that the ship was on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan. Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin, one of the Empire’s highest ranking officers, held Leia prisoner on the Death Star. They sought to recover the stolen data tapes and uncover the location of the hidden Rebel base, though they knew Leia would never give up its location voluntarily. As such, Vader used an interrogation droid to try and extract the information, but Leia was able to resist. Tarkin, however, found another form of persuasion: he would threaten to destroy her home planet of Alderaan unless she divulged the whereabouts of the base. Reluctantly, Leia confessed that it was Dantooine; Tarkin nefariously continued with the attack, looking to display the Death Star’s might. The Princess protested, but Tarkin and Vader would not listen. Alderaan was destroyed. But the Rebels still had time -- the Dantooine base had been abandoned long ago, which Leia knew, and the Alliance really resided on Yavin 4. Her situation seemingly dire, events would soon unfold that would change Leia’s fate and that of the galaxy. As it turns out, the message she hid inside R2-D2 was delivered on Tatooine to Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Master and a general in the Clone Wars who knew her father. Obi-Wan arrived on the Death Star with Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the two droids to rescue her. Luke reached Leia’s cell first, dressed in disguise as one of the Empire’s foot soldiers. “Aren’t you a little short for a stormtrooper?” she asked. Taking off his helmet, Luke introduced himself and the two quickly left. But by this time, stormtroopers had found the ragtag group, and Han, Chewie, Luke, and Leia were forced to jump into a trash compactor to hide. Han and Leia immediately clashed, with the Princess having little patience for his bravado. When the walls of the compactor began to close in, all seemed lost until R2-D2 was able to remotely shut them down. The group made their way back to Han’s ship, the Millennium Falcon, though Obi-Wan Kenobi fell in battle to Darth Vader. They escaped, but little did they know that Vader had placed a tracking device on their ship. Leia and her rescuers rendezvoused with the Alliance on Yavin 4, where she delivered the Death Star plans. As the Rebels prepped their attack on the space station, Han and Chewie collected their reward for saving the Princess and were readying to leave. Luke and Leia were disappointed in Han’s decision, but carried on. Meanwhile, having successfully tracked the Falcon to Yavin 4, the Death Star closed in. The attack began, with Luke piloting an X-wing, Leia monitoring in the command center, and Han long gone. As the Death Star readied to destroy to Yavin 4 and the Rebel Alliance with it, Han saved Luke by blasting the TIE fighters trailing his X-wing; Luke fired a proton torpedo into the Death Star’s exhaust port, destroying the planet-sized terror. Han, Chewie, and Luke returned to the base where Leia warmly greeted them, and later presented them medals for their bravery. After the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance relocated to Hoth, a remote ice world. Leia remained a key figure in the fight for freedom, and her feelings for Han had developed -- though he could still drive her crazy. “You stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf herder!” she called him in a heated exchange. After the Empire discovered their location, Leia oversaw the Alliance’s evacuation and was forced to leave with Han aboard the Millennium Falcon. Leia, Han, Chewbacca, and C-3PO evaded the Empire by heading into an asteroid field -- a dangerous move that only the daring captain of the Millennium Falcon would attempt. It worked, and Han docked his ship inside a cave within one of the larger rock masses. In a quiet moment, the smuggler and the Princess finally kissed -- only to be interrupted by C-3PO, who was excited to inform them that he’d isolated the ship’s reverse power flux coupling. The group later headed to Cloud City, home of Han’s old friend Lando Calrissian, for sanctuary. Upon arrival, Leia was skeptical of Lando -- he seemed a little too friendly. Her misgivings would prove true, as Lando handed his new guests over to Darth Vader and Boba Fett, claiming they arrived just before the Falcon. Han was tortured by Vader and Leia was held prisoner, all part of a trap to lure Luke Skywalker. The Sith Lord planned to carbon-freeze Luke, but would test the dangerous procedure on Han. Before being lowered into the freezing chamber, Leia told Han that she loved him. “I know,” he replied, and was then frozen into a carbonite slab. He survived the process, and Vader demanded Leia and Chewbacca be taken to his ship. While en route, Lando took a risk and had his security forces disarm their stormtrooper escort, and led Leia, Chewie, and C-3PO in a last ditch attempt to save Han. They were too late, but managed to flee in the Falcon. Luke, who came to face Vader, was severely injured and only survived by reaching out through the Force to Leia. The Princess commanded they return to rescue him; while the heroes were defeated, they survived to fight another day. With Han frozen in carbonite and held in Jabba's Palace on Tatooine, the Princess and her friends planned a rescue mission. Leia, disguised as bounty hunter Boushh, brought a captive Chewbacca before Jabba. She collected a bounty of 35,000 credits, and later that evening snuck quietly to Han’s carbonite slab. She unfroze the smuggler and revealed her identity to him as “someone who loves you.” They kissed and were ready to make their escape, but were interrupted by an ominous laugh; Jabba knew it was Leia the whole time. He threw Han in a cell with Chewbacca, and forced Leia to wear a slave girl outfit and remain by his side. But all was not lost. Luke appeared, and in Jabba’s botched execution of the Rebels above the Sarlacc pit, decimated the crime lord’s forces. In the ensuing chaos, Leia used the chain tethering her to Jabba to choke the giant gangster. He died in a pitiful slump, and Leia and her friends left Tatooine and headed for the stars. The Princess and the others rendezvoused with the Rebel fleet and helped organize a plan to destroy the Empire’s new Death Star: they would head to Endor and knock out the space station’s shield generator, while fighters would enter the super structure and take down the main reactor. Using a stolen Imperial shuttle, Leia and friends landed on the forest moon but quickly encountered Imperial scout troopers. Luke and Leia commandeered speeder bikes and defeated the troopers in a deadly chase and battle, but were separated. The Princess, alone, encountered a strange, furry being -- an Ewok named Wicket. He took her to his village, where she would remain until Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo showed up as captives (Threepio was mistaken for a god by the primitive species). After being freed, she and Luke had a private discussion away from the others where he made a startling revelation: they were actually brother and sister. Instead of shock, Leia seemed at peace. “I know,” she said. “Somehow, I’ve always known.” Luke went off to face Darth Vader, and Han and Leia led the ground assault on the shield generator. Always brave, Leia more than held her own, blasting stormtroopers left and right. While she was wounded, her injury wasn’t serious; and with help from their new furry friends, the Rebels defeated the Imperial legion of troops. The shield was destroyed, as was the Death Star and the Emperor. Luke turned Vader back to the light side and reunited with Leia, Han, and their friends on Endor -- together again with the battle for freedom finally over.",

After Tusken Raiders kidnapped Owen’s stepmother, a Jedi Padawan arrived in search of Shmi. This was Shmi’s son Anakin, the stepbrother Owen had wondered if he’d ever meet. For the most part, the Clone Wars were but a rumor on Tatooine. But soon after the Republic fell and the Empire rose in its place, a new visitor arrived at the Lars farm. Obi-Wan Kenobi had brought an infant boy for Owen and Beru to raise – Luke Skywalker, Anakin’s secret son. Owen came to love Luke, and feared the boy’s parentage might lead him into danger. He forbade Obi-Wan from visiting, and told Luke his father had merely been a navigator on a spice freighter. But despite Owen’s best efforts, Luke was no farmer – he yearned for adventure among the stars. When Jawa scavengers visited the Lars farm, Owen bought a pair of droids as help – the protocol droid C-3PO and the astromech R2-D2. Owen had no idea that the droids were fugitives from the Rebel Alliance – or that the Empire would kill its own citizens to retrieve the droids and the secret information they carried. While Luke was away from the farm, stormtroopers found the Jawas who’d picked up C-3PO and R2-D2, and learned the droids had been sold to Owen and Beru. When the stormtroopers didn’t find the droids at the Lars homestead, they killed Luke’s aunt and uncle and left the farm in flames.",

        history:
          "As a Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi was the headstrong apprentice to Qui-Gon Jinn. The two were dispatched to settle a dispute between the Trade Federation and the planet Naboo, but negotiations never took place -- the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, orchestrating the Trade Federation’s blockade of the planet, ordered the Jedi killed. Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon survived the trap, however, and fled to the planet’s surface. There, they finally connected with Queen Padmé Amidala of the Naboo, fled the planet, and landed on Tatooine. Qui-Gon and Padmé crossed paths with a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker who was unusually strong with the Force, helping the stranded heroes pay for starship parts by winning a Podrace. Anakin and Obi-Wan met for the first time after a near-deadly attack by a mysterious dark warrior, and the group headed home to Coruscant. In a surprise move, Queen Amidala decided to go back to Naboo to retake the planet, with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon escorting her. Little did they know that the dark menace from Tatooine, in truth a Sith named Darth Maul, was awaiting their arrival. The two Jedi dueled Maul in a fast, furious battle, which saw Qui-Gon fatally wounded. Obi-Wan continued the fight, but a Force push left him dangling above a deep shaft. Maul toyed with him, kicking Obi-Wan’s lightsaber into the abyss, but could not anticipate the Jedi’s bold move: he somersaulted over Maul, drew Qui-Gon’s Jedi weapon to his hand, and cut the Sith Lord in two. Kenobi ran to Qui-Gon, who with his dying wish asked Obi-Wan to train Anakin as a Jedi. And so it was: the Council granted Obi-Wan knighthood, and Anakin was named his Padawan. As Obi-Wan Kenobi continued to train Anakin Skywalker, the two were assigned as security for their old friend, Senator Padmé Amidala, after an assassination attempt on her life. After a second attempt, Obi-Wan and Anakin pursued her attacker, a clawdite bounty hunter named Zam Wesell. Following her into one of Coruscant’s seedy bars, Obi-Wan waited until Wesell approached him and severed her hand with a surprise cut from his lightsaber. The Jedi carried the wounded bounty hunter out into the street, where Wesell was mysteriously killed by a poison dart shot from above. Obi-Wan began an investigation, finding that the dart was from the planet Kamino -- a world which had been mysteriously erased from the Jedi Archives. On Kamino he discovered that a massive clone army had been created for the Republic -- in the name of a Jedi who had been dead for nearly 10 years -- and the genetic blueprint was bounty hunter Jango Fett. Looking to secure Jango, Kenobi battled Fett in the planet’s never-ending rain, with the bounty hunter escaping in his starship. Obi-Wan tracked Fett to Geonosis, where he found Separatist forces had gathered under the leadership of former Jedi Count Dooku. While reporting back to the Jedi, Obi-Wan was ambushed, taken prisoner, and sentenced to die in the Geonosis arena. He survived, killing a vicious acklay, and alongside other Jedi and the new clone army, fought off battle droids as the Clone War erupted around him. He and Anakin then engaged Count Dooku, who had turned to the dark side. Both Jedi suffered injuries in their failure to stop the Separatist leader.",
